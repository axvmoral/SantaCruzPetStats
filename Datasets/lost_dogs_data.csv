Here is what her foster family has to say: ""She is a lot of fun! She rides nicely in the car. With potty breaks every 4 hours, she is getting in the routine and has not had an accident in the house. She is getting used to the routine of getting her leash on and walks nicely on leash. She is friendly, loving and happy. Also very playful and energetic! I still cannot believe she is a granny. She is getting along with my 4 year old and occasionally they play together now!""Lily has enjoyed playing with dogs in the Shelter and has gone out on walks with them. A home with any resident dogs is likely a fit provided they meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. We do not recommend Lily live in a home with cats or small animals due to some observed prey drive.

Stella is a smart cookie who is looking for a home to thrive in. She originally came into the Shelter as quite the unruly teenager. This was understandable since she didn’t know exactly what to do and or when to do it. With some committed staff members, enrichment and socialization – Stella has started to get some tools under her belt to be the best canine citizen she can be. This girl is super smart and already knows “sit”. She would love to learn more through positive reinforcement based training with her new family. She enjoys going to playgroup with dog friends and would love to have a canine pal to rough and tumble with in the home OR access to playful dogs on a regular basis for playdates. When Stella is over tired, under stimulated, or bored – she tends to jump up on people and mouth them. This can be startling to some people, understandably but to Stella – she is trying to communicate. When her needs are met (play, training, rest), the jumpy/mouthy behavior does not usually occur. Adopters are recommended to be dog-savvy and understanding. We do not have any history of Stella with cats. A dog-savvy cat and a slow introduction may be a fit. Older, dog-savvy kids are recommended for Stella. Looking for a smart cookie to sweeten up your home? Come meet Stella today.",2023-11-16

She is currently in potty training and is doing awesome on a schedule. Small animals in the home are not recommended since she does not understand her own strength and is still learning what is appropriate to do when she gets excited. She loves to play with other medium to large size dogs in a rough and tumble fashion. Any kids in the home are recommended to be older and dog savvy.

This adolescent husky came to the Shelter as a stray so we do not know much about her life before now. A good Samaritan found her in Watsonville by Manresa Beach and held onto her for a couple days while trying to find her guardian. She did well with the resident dogs and 2 year old child in the home. She even saw a cat and didn’t chase it! Staff have observed that Fallon Is an active, playful puppy who would benefit from a guardian that will commit to positive reinforcement based training to help her gain some life skills and manners. She is still working on her leash and house training. If there is a resident dog in the home, it is recommended that they meet prior to adoption. Fallon would likely enjoy a playmate in the home. Fallon is currently hanging out in a foster home to take a break from the Shelter. Here is what her foster parent reports: ""Fallon is an absolute delight. She is friendly with everyone- kids, strangers, and loves making friends with other dogs. She has not barked, growled, or shown any aggression whatsoever. We’ve been to Nisene marks, East cliff and Henry Cowell and she loves everyone she meets. She is not aggressive towards the chickens as well. She loves playing with toys and chasing the ball. She sleeps through the night on a bed on the floor next to mine. She was nervous to come inside the house at first, I would guess she was not allowed inside in her previous home. She has gradually become more comfortable and comes inside by herself just after 2 days. She has been super chill and just happy and sweet. What a gem!!!!""",2023-11-16

Due to his mouthing, Miles is not recommended for an adoptive home with young children unless adopters are able to directly oversee any and all interactions to ensure they are safe. We do not have any history of Miles with cats. A home with kitties may be a fit with a slow introduction and management. Miles is not house trained. Adopters will need to commit to a positive reinforcement based training to help Miles learn about the world and how to interact with individuals in a safe and positive manner.",2023-11-16
