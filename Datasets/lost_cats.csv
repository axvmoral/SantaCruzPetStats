A wonderful foster parent offerred to take them in to help them gain confidence about the world around them. With time and patience, these two kittens have blossomed and are ready for an adoptive home together. Here is what their foster parents have to say about them: ""These two boys are being a real joy to foster. They love to play and are both well behaved and healthy kitties. They are litter-box trained and really enjoy their meals. Smokey is outgoing and talkative while Bandit is still a little shy. But with patience and love and lots of ""play sessions"" he has been coming around. He and Smokey play and sleep together and would be so happy to go to their new home as a ""bonded pair"".""Interested in meeting them? Come down to the Shelter today to set up a meet and greet appointment. ",2023-11-14

Staff saw potential in her and have started to see her bloom into a lovely, affectionate girl. She is still very shy but is making leaps and bounds every day. Miriam's ideal home would be a loving companion that has a quiet living space where she can be fully indoors to help keep her safe and to continue to make progress in her socialbility. We do not know her history prior to coming to the shelter but we would love for her to find her very special person to give her the life we know she deserves! If YOU are that special person, please head down to the WATSONVILLE SHELTER and come meet this lovely lady. We do not have any history of Miriam with other animals- ideally mellow pets in the home would be best and introduced slowly if you have any other pets at home. aat",2023-11-14

This kitten came into the Shelter as a stray with her littermates. Linden is an adorable long haired floof. She can be a bit shy at first but once she warms up, she is a doll. Linden would likely do well in a variety of homes. Any introductions to resident animals should be done in a slow, thoughtful manner.  Linden's adoption fee is reduced by $20 thanks to the Laurie Roberts Bogey Fund - a fund to draw adopter's attention towards the often overlooked black cats and kittens in Shelter.",2023-11-14
