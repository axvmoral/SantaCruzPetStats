Stella is a smart cookie who is looking for a home to thrive in. She originally came into the Shelter as quite the unruly teenager. This was understandable since she didn’t know exactly what to do and or when to do it. With some committed staff members, enrichment and socialization – Stella has started to get some tools under her belt to be the best canine citizen she can be. This girl is super smart and already knows “sit”. She would love to learn more through positive reinforcement based training with her new family. She enjoys going to playgroup with dog friends and would love to have a canine pal to rough and tumble with in the home OR access to playful dogs on a regular basis for playdates. When Stella is over tired, under stimulated, or bored – she tends to jump up on people and mouth them. This can be startling to some people, understandably but to Stella – she is trying to communicate. When her needs are met (play, training, rest), the jumpy/mouthy behavior does not usually occur. Adopters are recommended to be dog-savvy and understanding. We do not have any history of Stella with cats. A dog-savvy cat and a slow introduction may be a fit.

Staff have observed that Fallon Is an active, playful puppy who would benefit from a guardian that will commit to positive reinforcement based training to help her gain some life skills and manners. She is still working on her leash and house training. If there is a resident dog in the home, it is recommended that they meet prior to adoption. Fallon would likely enjoy a playmate in the home. Fallon is currently hanging out in a foster home to take a break from the Shelter. Here is what her foster parent reports: ""Fallon is an absolute delight. She is friendly with everyone- kids, strangers, and loves making friends with other dogs. She has not barked, growled, or shown any aggression whatsoever. We’ve been to Nisene marks, East cliff and Henry Cowell and she loves everyone she meets. She is not aggressive towards the chickens as well. She loves playing with toys and chasing the ball. She sleeps through the night on a bed on the floor next to mine. She was nervous to come inside the house at first, I would guess she was not allowed inside in her previous home. She has gradually become more comfortable and comes inside by herself just after 2 days. She has been super chill and just happy and sweet. What a gem!!!!""",2023-11-16
