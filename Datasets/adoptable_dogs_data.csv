This spirited senior husky is looking for a fun-loving home to live out her golden years. She is currently in a foster home with a family including some young children. Here is what her foster family has to say: ""She is a lot of fun! She rides nicely in the car. With potty breaks every 4 hours, she is getting in the routine and has not had an accident in the house. She is getting used to the routine of getting her leash on and walks nicely on leash. She is friendly, loving and happy. Also very playful and energetic! I still cannot believe she is a granny. She is getting along with my 4 year old and occasionally they play together now!""Lily has enjoyed playing with dogs in the Shelter and has gone out on walks with them. A home with any resident dogs is likely a fit provided they meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. We do not recommend Lily live in a home with cats or small animals due to some observed prey drive.

Stella is a smart cookie who is looking for a home to thrive in. She originally came into the Shelter as quite the unruly teenager. This was understandable since she didn’t know exactly what to do and or when to do it. With some committed staff members, enrichment and socialization – Stella has started to get some tools under her belt to be the best canine citizen she can be. This girl is super smart and already knows “sit”. She would love to learn more through positive reinforcement based training with her new family. She enjoys going to playgroup with dog friends and would love to have a canine pal to rough and tumble with in the home OR access to playful dogs on a regular basis for playdates. When Stella is over tired, under stimulated, or bored – she tends to jump up on people and mouth them. This can be startling to some people, understandably but to Stella – she is trying to communicate. When her needs are met (play, training, rest), the jumpy/mouthy behavior does not usually occur. Adopters are recommended to be dog-savvy and understanding. We do not have any history of Stella with cats. A dog-savvy cat and a slow introduction may be a fit. Older, dog-savvy kids are recommended for Stella. Looking for a smart cookie to sweeten up your home? Come meet Stella today.",2023-11-24

She knows “sit” and “look” and is working on “come” as well as her puppy mouthing when she gets excited. She sleeps through the night in a crate and is very food motivated. She is currently in potty training and is doing awesome on a schedule. Small animals in the home are not recommended since she does not understand her own strength and is still learning what is appropriate to do when she gets excited. She loves to play with other medium to large size dogs in a rough and tumble fashion. Any kids in the home are recommended to be older and dog savvy.

She is still working on her leash and house training. If there is a resident dog in the home, it is recommended that they meet prior to adoption. Fallon would likely enjoy a playmate in the home. Fallon is currently hanging out in a foster home to take a break from the Shelter. Here is what her foster parent reports: ""Fallon is an absolute delight. She is friendly with everyone- kids, strangers, and loves making friends with other dogs. She has not barked, growled, or shown any aggression whatsoever. We’ve been to Nisene marks, East cliff and Henry Cowell and she loves everyone she meets. She is not aggressive towards the chickens as well. She loves playing with toys and chasing the ball. She sleeps through the night on a bed on the floor next to mine. She was nervous to come inside the house at first, I would guess she was not allowed inside in her previous home. She has gradually become more comfortable and comes inside by herself just after 2 days. She has been super chill and just happy and sweet. What a gem!!!!""",2023-11-24

Colby came in as a stray to the Shelter initially. He was a nervous guy in the Shelter  environment so staff worked to find him a foster home so we could see who the real Colby is. Colby is in a foster home with a couple and their 11 and 15 year old child. Here is what the foster family has to say about him: “Colby is a sweet boy that loves to play fetch. Not only does he bring the bacll back to you but he will toss it your way or place it in your lap. He travels really well and happily jumps up into the car. In the car, he goes into his car seat and often just naps on car rides. Colby is very treat motivated and is working on “sit” and “stay”. He appears to be house trained and has not had an accidents in the home. He has been sleeping in a crate in our bedroom at night but I have a feeling he would rather be on our bed. He likes to sit on laps, lay on the couch, or in a dog bed during the day (when he is not playing fetch). He seems to have a preferred person but does like everyone in the house and will follow and check in with everyone. Colby will sometimes let out a little bark – that seems to be his way of alerting us to the fact that he has heard something he thinks is interesting but hasn’t reacted to the door bell, other dogs barking, or emergency vehicle sirens passing by. Colby loves to help wake up the 11 and 15 year olds every morning by running into their bedroom and giving them a little boop with his nose. He cuddles with them in bed before bringing them his ball to play!”If you are interested in meeting Colby, come down to the Shelter to set up a meet and greet!",2023-12-06

He was around children ages 5 years old to teenage age. Bonsai was a bit spooked by the young children so a home with dog-savvy, older children is recommended. He coexisted nicely with two exuberant huskies. In the Shelter, Bonsai has met a small breed dog and was a bit conflicted – interested but nervous to interact. A home with another dog may be a fit for Bonsai provided they meet at the Shetler prior to adoption. Bonsai would thrive in a lower traffic, quiet home that will allow him to transition. He craves human companionship and would like to be around his people more often than not. Busy environments such as dog parks and walking areas is not recommended as they are likely to overwhelm Bonsai.

She has met other dogs at the Shelter and has been polite with them. A home with another dog may be a fit provided they meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. Tuppence has shown a bit of a knack for escaping. She is skilled in climbing fences/doors to go find greener pastures. Adopters will be required to have Tuppence on a secure collar, harness and leash set up when out in the world. Tuppence should not be left unattended outdoors. With time and patience, we anticipate that Tuppence will bond with her people and her escape orientations with decrease. We do not have any history of Tuppence with cats.

The gunshot completely shattered his large humerus bone leaving the only possible course to amputate his right front leg. Despite the challenges he’s faced, Oso’s spirit remains unbroken, and he’s faced his new reality with a calm, reserved determination that seems to reflect a mild, friendly, somewhat stoic personality. “Front leg amputation in a large dog requires significant re-strengthening and re-conditioning of the remaining front leg and spine. Most of that comes naturally through regular walking and movement, but he’ll need a gradual return to regular activities as he recovers. Because of the strain on his remaining front he may tire easily, he can’t be expected to climb or descend many stairs, and he’ll need lifelong joint support like staying lean, joint supplements, and physical support or lifting for some activities, like getting in and out of the car,” said Dr. Brenn-White. “Arthritis may develop prematurely, so regular vet care will be essential, and some pain control will likely be needed down the road. Our team will provide information and guidance, but his new home will need to be ready to provide the extra support and care he’ll need.”Due to his reserved personality and his medical situation, it’s been challenging to fully assess his temperament, but we know that he’s lived well with other dogs in the encampment setting, his owners loved and cared about him very much, he was not known as a problem dog in the community, and at the shelter he's enjoyed petting and has shown calm, friendly behavior toward other friendly dogs. The Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter believes that Oso's story can serve as a powerful testament to the resilience of animals and the importance of providing second chances, as well as the devastating consequences of gun violence. We are actively seeking a special adopter who can offer Oso the understanding, patience, and commitment he needs.",2024-01-11

She was more confident outside of the Shelter and showed her more playful side. She enjoyed hanging out with her foster family and solicited play from the resident dogs in the home. Their foster described her as very sweet, loving attention and treats. Leena is still working on life skills and manners such as walking on leash and potty training. She has allowed grooming in the foster home and would need regular grooming every 6-ish weeks to keep up with her coat. We do not have history of Leena with children or cats. A home with dog savvy kids may be a fit. Any resident cats should be confident and introduced in a slow, thoughtful manner to set everyone up for success. ",2024-01-11

Gigi, understandably, VERY dog social and finds comfort in having a canine companion with her to provide guidance. At the Shelter, Gigi has enjoyed playgroup and socializing with dogs of various sizes - larger breed shepherds to little puppies. A home with another dog savvy, confident dog is required to help set Gigi up for success. Gigi's ideal adopters are dog savvy and patient to set Gigi up for success. Gigi makes great choices when she is nervous - moving away, putting her ears back, going towards the people ""in her circle"" for guidance and referring to other dogs. Adopters should reward Gigi for appropriate behaviors when she is nervous and respect her request for distance. Through positive reinforcement and behavior modification, Gigi will likely blossom into a really sweet, social girl. An adults only home with another dog in a quieter area will allow for Gigi to show her soft, social side. Does that sound like your place?

Here is what her foster parent reports: ""So far in foster Lady is an absolute delight. She loves to play with toys, people, her resident foster brother, and sometimes her tail. She greets new people with kisses and flops on her back for belly rubs. She likes going outside for walks or running laps in the yard. She is pottying both inside and outside while decompressing to her new surroundings. Lady is an active pup who likes a good time and is sure to make her people smile."" Interested in meeting Lady?

Elle came to the Shelter as an owner surrender after her previous guardian was unable to continue caring for her. This gal is small, sweet and sensitive. She warms up to strangers once she is comfortable but tends to keep to herself in the meantime. Once comfortable, she enjoys TLC, playing fetch and being with “her people”. Elle would thrive in a home as the only pet. Meeting other dogs and having them invade her circle makes her uncomfortable. Adopters will need to set Elle up for success by giving her the space she is requesting from other dogs. She has a history of being crated trained from her previous home and settles nicely in it. Loud noises (like fireworks)  and sudden movements spook Elle. This smart cookie knows “sit”, “down” and “wait”. An adopter that is committed to positive reinforcement based training will create a great bond with Elle and provide her with some additional life skills and manners in her next home. Elle has lived with kids under the age of 12 in her previous home. Dog-savvy kids in the home may be a fit but are required to meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. Elle has a history of riding nicely in the car. If you are looking for a devoted darling of a sidekick – come meet Elle today!",2024-02-16

A home with another dog may be a fit provided there is a meet and greet at the Shelter and thoughtful management in the home. We do not have any history of Samba with children or cats. Socialization, life skills and manners, and bonding are on the agenda for any new adopter. Adopters are required to utilize positive reinforcement based training to set their relationship up with this puppy up for success.   Have you heard about our adoption special?During the month of October, you choose the amount you pay for an adoption (at least $50 suggested) and what your adoption supports. Your donation can assist with special medical care, food & supplies, and owner support for the residents of Santa Cruz County and their companion animals. Your support allows us to save hundreds of additional animal lives and support families and pets in need. Whatever you decide to donate in place of an adoption fee, your new pet will be spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and treated for parasites. We want to get every pet off to a healthy start in a new home!",2024-02-27

Bodhi came to the Shelter after his previous guardian was unable to continue caring for him. He lived in a home with another dog who he coexisted with. Adopters should anticipate that Bodhi may not be every dog’s cup of tea as he comes on strong in his attempts to interact. He has had successful play sessions at the Shelter. A resident dog that is playful and dog savvy may be a fit paired with an adopter that will oversee and manage all interactions, especially in the transition. Bodhi does get frustrated on leash and behind barriers when seeing other dogs. A home that is in a lower dog traffic area and does not frequent off leash areas (dog parks, beaches, etc) is required to set Bodhi up for success. Adopters will also need to commit to force free training. Bodhi was house trained in his previous home. This active guy loves running, hiking and fetch. He also knows “sit”, “wait’, “stay” and “down”.",2024-02-29

He has been spending the last 2 weeks with a resident female husky/golden retriever mix (7 yo) AND a sassy senior torti kitty (12yo). He has done well with both & has learned to “give the kitty space” :) Max & the other dog have also quickly become buddies, he listens to her cues and is very observant. His favorite activities are : playing with other dog friends (getting the zoomies out), chewing on sticks & farm animal no hide bones, peanut butter filled kongs & any enrichment toys! While in foster Max has been learning the routine of crate training, potty training & basic tricks like sit, stay & down. He is VERY smart and a quick learner! His kind eyes will steal your heart, that’s for certain. The ideal home for Max is a family with either another patient resident dog or someone who is ready to give him the time, attention & love he needs to thrive.

This Anatolian Labrador mix came to the Shelter after his previous guardians could no longer care for him. Brees had been in the same home since being a puppy. His favorite things to do are lounge around the house, go for walks and chase squirrels. Brees is a smart cookie and knows “sit”, “stay”, “shake”, “high-five”, “lay down”, “eat” and “go to bed”. He would love a companion that will continue working with him through positive reinforcement based training to keep up his life skills and learn new things! Brees was described as house trained and crate trained in his previous home. He lived with a four year old child and did well. Although Brees previously has gone to doggy daycare and done well meeting dogs in the world, he has been stressed at the Shelter which is creating some un-comfortability around other dogs.

This small/medium guy came to us from our friends at Oakland Animal Services. Thatcher has attended small dog playgroup since arriving at the Shelter and has done well. He can be vocal in play so any resident dogs should be comfortable with that. Thatcher was reportedly nervous of strangers in his previous home. Staff have observed him barking at people approaching when out in playgroup but once they enter, he greets and is social with them. Adopters may need to manage this behavior by decreasing access to looking out windows and doors as Thatcher may enjoy being ""neighborhood watch"" a bit too much. He may be able to live with cats with a slow introduction and management. Any kids in the home should meet prior to adoption. Thatcher is looking to be someone's BFF for daily walks and adventures.

Chico is a little young terrier that is looking for a special adopter. Chico was found as a stray and was VERY scared when he first arrived. When people would approach him, he would move away and tell people that he needed more space by barking and growling at them. Over time, Chico has made great strides in realizing the world is not so scary. Although Chico has made progress, he will likely need some time to transition again in his adoptive home. A dog savvy adopter that will respect Chico’s body language, manage his environment and be patient in the transition will be the best bet at setting Chico up for success. Chico is required to go to a child-free home. Chico has met dogs at the Shelter and sniffs politely and is fairly indifferent. A well socialized dog in the home may be a fit for him and help to show him that the world is not so scary. Any resident dogs should meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. We do not have any history of Chico with cats or small animals. Provided there is a slow introduction and management, Chico may coexist nicely with cats and/or small animals. Chico is likely to grow more confident in the world around him and settle nicely in his adoptive home but may never be a social butterfly.

This Malinois mix came into the Shelter as a stray found in Watsonville. We do not know about Indy’s past. Indy was nervous when he first arrived but has gained a ton of experience. Indy has been social and outgoing with staff and volunteers at the Shelter. He is treat motivated and would love to continue learning and working his brain in his adoptive home. A guardian that will commit to positive reinforcement based training is required to help set Indy up for success in his adoptive home. Indy will likely need above average mental and physical stimulation to ensure that he has all the tools he needs to settle and be a companion dog. He has met dogs at the Shelter. Indy can be a bit frustrated on leash and behind barriers around other dogs. He has met other dogs and played successfully. A dog-savvy dog that enjoys playing a game of chase and some wrestling may be a fit for Indy provided they meet at the Shelter prior to adoption. We are not recommending Indy to go to a home with cats. A home with sturdy children may be a fit. Interested in a workout buddy? Come meet Indy today!,2024-04-11

When Shadow first meets someone, she can be really shy and might try running away from you. But as long as you provide her with a safe and calm environment and let her direct the pace of the relationship, I ensure you that she will warm up to you. She is still getting used to the world and will need the guidance and positive training to continue getting well socialized. She absolutely loves cats. She is always trying to make friends with them and play. She can warm up to any size dog as long as the dog is respectful of her space and lets her guide the interactions. She also relies on her safety person a lot to reassure her that she is okay and safe around new dogs. She can be bit barky at other dogs at first or when on leash. But always settles down once she is comfortable. She just likes the dogs to know that she is small but feisty. She is full of energy and loves to play fetch and just be a dog. Most of her days consist of her running around the yard with my two adolescent large breed dogs and would probably thrive with a confident dog by her side.  She loves to explore just as much as she loves to cuddle. She is crate trained (she loves having blankets in her crate to wrap herself in). She is doing amazing with potty training too. The only accidents were in the rainy days. oh yeah, she for sure does not like the rain. She has great recall and does know her name. She is truly a great dog who is just looking for a safe and calm home.",2024-04-23

He walked around the property on leash and even took a little pee outside after a nap.He’s pretty adventurous, but definitely likes his snuggle time."" If you are looking for a puppy to adopt, come to the Shelter to meet Enzo.
